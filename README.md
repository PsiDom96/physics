# Physics: Models, Simulations and Results

Here is where I will be posting small projects related to various physics problems.
These project will be similar to those you might find in a Computational Physics course, although there will generally be less focus on the specific numerical techniques, and more focus on practical applications. 

## What to look for:
* Simulations of real-world and 'everyday' phenomena
* Interesting physics problems relevant to various technologies
* Playing around with various physics and computational tools
