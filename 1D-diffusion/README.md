# 1D Heat Transfer Simulation

This project simulates transient 1D heat conduction through a multilayer material using the finite difference method (FDM).

## Features
- Explicit FDM scheme for time evolution
- Custom material stack with different thermal properties
- Visualization and animation of temperature profiles
- Layer shading to distinguish materials

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### The notebook will create an animation and save it as an html file to open localy in a browser.
